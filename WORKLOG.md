# ThreeJS Code Reorganization and Enhancement

## Overview

The codebase has been reorganized from a monolithic structure into a modular, component-based architecture. This organization improves code maintainability, reusability, and makes it easier to add new features in the future.

## Architectural Structure

The new architecture follows a clear separation of concerns:

- **Core**: Base classes and managers for the overall application structure
- **Scenes**: Scene implementations that compose different objects
- **Objects**: Individual 3D objects that make up the scenes
- **Shaders**: Shader implementations for custom visual effects
- **Utils**: Utility classes for common functionality
- **Store**: State management for game data and UI

## File Structure and Descriptions

### Core

- **`src/three/core/SceneManager.ts`** - Main controller that manages the ThreeJS renderer, scenes, and animation loop. Entry point for the ThreeJS application.
- **`src/three/core/Scene.ts`** - Abstract base class that all scenes inherit from, providing common scene functionality.

### Scenes

- **`src/three/scenes/CyberpunkScene.ts`** - Cyberpunk-themed scene that composes grid, mountains, sun, and hoverboard objects with appropriate lighting. Now includes game controls and mechanics.

### Objects

- **`src/three/objects/Grid.ts`** - Represents the floor grid with an opaque gradient surface and grid lines overlay. Creates a visually appealing cyberpunk ground.
- **`src/three/objects/Mountains.ts`** - Procedurally generated distant mountains using Perlin noise for a dynamic landscape effect.
- **`src/three/objects/Sun.ts`** - Synthwave sun with gradient shader for vibrant background effects.
- **`src/three/objects/HoverBoard.ts`** - Hovering board with glowing effects that floats above the grid. Features shader-based holographic materials. Now includes a 3-lane movement system and game mechanics.

### Shaders

- **`src/three/shaders/SunShader.ts`** - Shader implementation for the synthwave sun with gradient and glow effects.
- **`src/three/shaders/HoverboardShader.ts`** - Shader for the hoverboard with fresnel effects, grid patterns, and color transitions.

### Utils

- **`src/three/utils/PerlinNoise.ts`** - Perlin noise implementation for procedural terrain generation.
- **`src/three/utils/RoundedBoxGeometry.ts`** - Utility class for creating boxes with rounded corners, used for the hoverboard.

### Store

- **`src/three/store/gameStore.ts`** - Jotai-based state management for game state, distance tracking, and score.

### Entry Point

- **`src/three/init.ts`** - Initialization module that exposes functions to start and clean up the ThreeJS application.
